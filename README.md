## D3-SCoMoS - A D3 Based Library to Render Biological Networks

### Features

1. Can be used to visualize biological networks 
2. Input JSON which is highly compatible with the standard SBML format
3. Supports microarray overlay visualizations which are necessary for systems biology pathways. Allows advanced analysis of various genes by coloring nodes based expression values.
4. Allows to select the multiple entities
5. Supports 12 types of Species, 6 types of Reactions, 2 types of Modifiers and 2 types of Compartments. The shapes are designed by referring SBGN standards.
6. Use simply by adding as a script in your projects.

### What's Different 

1. Comes with well-defined validations to avoid invalid data being entered into the model
2. Provides methods for easy modification of graph entities like Species, Reactions and Compartments
3. All manipulations to the graph can be recorded by built-in undo manager
4. Various custom events for specific tasks

### Building this library

1. run the gulp task "concat_d3scomos" will generate concatenated build in dist folder.
2. running tests:
	*  Go to folder tests open index.html.
	*  This  will take care of running tests and showing reports
3. code coverage (to be added).
  
### Example

1. Include in your project 
     `<script src="/js/D3_SCoMoS/d3/d3.js"></script>`  
     `<script src="/js/D3_SCoMoS/dist/d3scomos.js"></script>`  
  2.  Select div to draw graph on 
      `var sGraph = d3scomos.eskinModel(d3.select('#chart'),{'height':"450px"});`
  3.  Pass your SBML JSON to library
      `sGraph.generate(your_sbml_json_obj);` 
  4.  Set mode to select 
      `sGraph.setPanMode(dragMode);
